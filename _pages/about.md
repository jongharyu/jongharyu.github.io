I am currently a postdoctoral associate at MIT, hosted by [Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/).
Prior to joining MIT, I received my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/),
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Young-Han Kim](https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
My graduate study was generously supported by the [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://www.ikef.or.kr/).
Before the graduate study, I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.S. in [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/) (with minor in [Physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en)) with the highest distinction from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr).

I am interested in a broad range of topics related to learning from data, both in theory and practice.
My recent research focuses on:

- **New machine learning techniques for scalable scientific simulation**
  - methodologies: parametric operator SVD frameworks ([NeuralSVD [ICML'24a]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03655), [NestedOMM [NeurIPS'25b]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21952))  
  - applications: analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems ([NeuralSVD on Koopman operator [NeurIPS'25a]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222))

- **New techniques for probabilistic inference**
  - an efficient framework for training one-step, high-quality generative models ([Score-of-Mixture Training [ICML'25a]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09609))  
  - unifying principles for learning with energy-based models [[ICML'25b](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18209)]
  - fixing CPC/InfoNCE for information estimation [[arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25983)]

- **New techniques and perspectives for uncertainty quantification**
  - universal gambling-based time-uniform confidence sets [[TransIT'24]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12382), [[ICML'24b]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03683), and applications [[COLT'25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10826)  
  - identifying pitfalls of evidential deep learning [[NeurIPS'24]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06160)

[//]: # (  - from universal compression to parameter-free online optimization [[AISTATS2022]]&#40;http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02406&#41;)

[//]: # (  - information-theoretic common representation learning &#40;[variational Wyner model [arXiv]]&#40;http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10945&#41;&#41;)

[//]: # (  - unifying evidential deep learning methods for uncertainty quantification [[NeurIPS2024]&#40;http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06160&#41;])

As an information theorist by training, I enjoy doing research by simplifying intricate ideas, unifying concepts, and generalizing them to address complex problems.
