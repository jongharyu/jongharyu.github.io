I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/)/[RLE](https://www.rle.mit.edu), hosted by [Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/).  
My research develops the **mathematical foundations of scientific machine learning**, aiming for scalable and reliable methods for scientific inference and modeling.  
A central theme in my work is **characterizing and leveraging spectral and information-theoretic structure** in scientific machine learning problems.

I am on the academic job market for the 2025–2026 academic cycle.

## background
[//]: #
Before MIT, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Young-Han Kim](https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/), supported by the [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://www.ikef.or.kr/). I hold dual B.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, with a minor in Physics, from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr), graduating with the highest distinction.
