I am currently a postdoctoral associate at MIT, hosted by [Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/).
Prior to joining MIT, I received my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Young-Han Kim](https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
My graduate study was generously supported by the [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://www.ikef.or.kr/).
Before the graduate study, I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.S. in [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/) (with minor in [Physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en)) with the highest distinction from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in 2015.

In general, I aim to develop fundamental yet practical algorithms for machine learning and data science.\
My recent research topics include:
- neural-net-based methods for large-scale spectral decomposition problems [[NeuralSVD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03655)];
- representation learning [[NeuralSVD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03655); [WynerVAE](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10945); [kernel embedding without EVD](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9517746)];
- sequential decision making / online learning
  - universal-gambling-based confidence sequences [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12382),[[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03683); 
  - [universal-gambling-based parameter-free online learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02406);
- learning with uncertainty quantification [[is evidential deep learning reliable?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06160)].

As an information theorist by training, 
I enjoy doing research by simplifying intricate ideas, unifying concepts, and generalizing them to address complex problems.
