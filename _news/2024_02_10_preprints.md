Three preprints about (1) [how to perform SVD using neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03655), (2) [how to improve uncertainty quantification in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06160), and (3) [how to construct time-uniform confidence sets for bounded vector-valued processes using gambling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03683) have been posted on arXiv.\
Please reach out if you have any comments or questions on any of these!
