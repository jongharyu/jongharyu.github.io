  abstract={A new approach to $L_2$-consistent estimation of a general density functional using k-nearest neighbor distances is proposed, where the functional under consideration is in the form of the expectation of some function f of the densities at each point. The estimator is designed to be asymptotically unbiased, using the convergence of the normalized volume of a $k$-nearest neighbor ball to a Gamma distribution in the large-sample limit, and naturally involves the inverse Laplace transform of a scaled version of the function $f$. Some instantiations of the proposed estimator recover existing $k$-nearest neighbor based estimators of Shannon and Rényi entropies and Kullback–Leibler and Rényi divergences, and discover new consistent estimators for many other functionals such as logarithmic entropies and divergences. The $L_2$-consistency of the proposed estimator is established for a broad class of densities for general functionals, and the convergence rate in mean squared error is established as a function of the sample size for smooth, bounded densities.},

This paper revisits the gambling-based approach established in the recent literature from a natural \emph{two-horse race} perspective, and demonstrates new properties of the resulting algorithm induced by Cover (1991)'s universal portfolio.
The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with constant per-round time complexity.
A higher-order generalization of a lower bound on a logarithmic function in (Fan et al., 2015), which is developed as a key technique for the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.},

At the core of the proposed CUDE algorithm is symbol-by-symbol universal denoising used by the celebrated DUDE algorithm, whereby the optimal estimate of the source from an unknown distribution is computed by inverting the empirical distribution of the noisy observation sequence by a deep neural network, which naturally and implicitly aggregates multi-pie contexts of similar characteristics and estimates the conditional distribution more accurately. The performance of CUDE is evaluated for grayscale images of varying bit depths, which improves upon DUDE and its recent neural network based extension, Neural DUDE.},

These algorithms combine the reduction technique of Orabona and P{\'a}l (2016) for adapting coin betting algorithms for online linear optimization with universal compression techniques in information theory for incorporating sequential side information to coin betting.
Concrete examples are studied in which the side information has a tree structure and consists of quantized values of the previous symbols of the adversarial sequence, including fixed-order and variable-order Markov cases.
By modifying the context-tree weighting technique of Willems, Shtarkov, and Tjalkens (1995), the proposed algorithm is further refined to achieve the best performance over all adaptive algorithms with tree-structured side information of a given maximum order in a computationally efficient manner.},

We demonstrate its effectiveness in speech spectrogram compression. Specifically, we show that the FRAE, paired with a powerful neural vocoder, can produce high-quality speech waveforms at a low, fixed bitrate. We further show that by adding a learned prior for the latent space and using an entropy coder, we can achieve an even lower variable bitrate.},

  abstract={Learning a fair predictive model is crucial to mitigate biased decisions against minority groups in high-stakes applications.
  A common approach to learn such a model involves solving an optimization problem that maximizes the predictive power of the model under an appropriate group fairness constraint.
  However, in practice, sensitive attributes are often missing or noisy resulting in uncertainty.
  We demonstrate that solely enforcing fairness constraints on uncertain sensitive attributes can fall significantly short in achieving the level of fairness of models trained without uncertainty.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a bootstrap-based algorithm that achieves the target level of fairness despite the uncertainty in sensitive attributes.
  The algorithm is guided by a Gaussian analysis for the independence notion of fairness where we propose a robust quadratically constrained quadratic problem to ensure a strict fairness guarantee with uncertain sensitive attributes.
  Our algorithm is applicable to both discrete and continuous sensitive attributes and is effective in real-world classification and regression tasks for various group fairness notions, e.g., independence and separation.},

For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques.
This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new techniques called nesting for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order.
The proposed method promotes the desired orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms.

  This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means of bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling framework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded random processes.
  The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for constructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as well as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple reduction.
  This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio, akin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates the properties of the resulting CSs.
  Simulations demonstrate the tightness of these confidence sequences compared to existing methods.
  When applied to the sampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown that the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably tighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by Waudby-Smith and Ramdas.},

  abstract={This paper questions the effectiveness of a modern predictive uncertainty quantification approach, called \emph{evidential deep learning} (EDL), in which a single neural network model is trained to learn a meta distribution over the predictive distribution by minimizing a specific objective function. Despite their perceived strong empirical performance on downstream tasks, a line of recent studies by Bengs et al. identify limitations of the existing methods to conclude their learned epistemic uncertainties are unreliable, e.g., in that they are non-vanishing even with infinite data. Building on and sharpening such analysis, we 1) provide a sharper understanding of the asymptotic behavior of a wide class of EDL methods by unifying various objective functions; 2) reveal that the EDL methods can be better interpreted as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm based on energy-based-models; and 3) conduct extensive ablation studies to better assess their empirical effectiveness with real-world datasets. Through all these analyses, we conclude that even when EDL methods are empirically effective on downstream tasks, this occurs despite their poor uncertainty quantification capabilities. Our investigation suggests that incorporating model uncertainty can help EDL methods faithfully quantify uncertainties and further improve performance on representative downstream tasks, albeit at the cost of additional computational complexity.},

Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals that our method achieves a significantly better, variance-adaptive guarantee upon prior art. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization objective for off-policy learning that strikes a difference balance in bias and variance. One special case that we call freezing tends to induce small variance, which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that they match the best existing guarantee. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.},

We consider a distributed learning scenario, in which a massive dataset is split into smaller groups, where the $k$-NNs are found for a query point with respect to each subset of data.
We propose \emph{optimal} rules to aggregate the fixed-$k$-NN information for classification, regression, and density estimation that achieve minimax optimal rates for the respective problems.
We show that the distributed algorithm with a fixed $k$ over a sufficiently large number of groups attains a minimax optimal error rate up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor under some regularity conditions.
Roughly speaking, distributed $k$-NN rules with $M$ groups has a performance comparable to the standard $\Theta(kM)$-NN rules even for fixed $k$.},

  abstract={A new bimodal generative model is proposed for generating conditional and joint samples, accompanied with a training method with learning a succinct bottleneck representation.
The proposed model, dubbed as the variational Wyner model, is designed based on two classical problems in network information theory---distributed simulation and channel synthesis---in which Wyner's common information arises as the fundamental limit on the succinctness of the common representation.
The model is trained by minimizing the symmetric Kullback--Leibler divergence between variational and model distributions with regularization terms for common information, reconstruction consistency, and latent space matching terms, which is carried out via an adversarial density ratio estimation technique.
The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as a challenging zero-shot image retrieval task.},

  abstract={Recommender systems aim to find an accurate and efficient mapping from historic data of user-preferred items to a new item that is to be liked by a user. Towards this goal, energy-based sequence generative adversarial nets (EB-SeqGANs) are adopted for recommendation by learning a generative model for the time series of user-preferred items. By recasting the energy function as the feature function, the proposed EB-SeqGANs is interpreted as an instance of maximum-entropy imitation learning.},
