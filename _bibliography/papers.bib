  abstract={A simple and scalable denoising algorithm is proposed that can be applied to a wide range of source and noise models. At the core of the proposed CUDE algorithm is symbol-by-symbol universal denoising used by the celebrated DUDE algorithm, whereby the optimal estimate of the source from an unknown distribution is computed by inverting the empirical distribution of the noisy observation sequence by a deep neural network, which naturally and implicitly aggregates multi-pie contexts of similar characteristics and estimates the conditional distribution more accurately. The performance of CUDE is evaluated for grayscale images of varying bit depths, which improves upon DUDE and its recent neural network based extension, Neural DUDE.},

The estimator is designed to be asymptotically unbiased, using the convergence of the normalized volume of a $k$-nearest neighbor ball to a Gamma distribution in the large-sample limit, and naturally involves the inverse Laplace transform of a scaled version of the function $f$. Some instantiations of the proposed estimator recover existing $k$-nearest neighbor based estimators of Shannon and Rényi entropies and Kullback–Leibler and Rényi divergences, and discover new consistent estimators for many other functionals such as logarithmic entropies and divergences. The $L_2$-consistency of the proposed estimator is established for a broad class of densities for general functionals, and the convergence rate in mean squared error is established as a function of the sample size for smooth, bounded densities.},

These algorithms combine the reduction technique of Orabona and P{\'a}l (2016) for adapting coin betting algorithms for online linear optimization with universal compression techniques in information theory for incorporating sequential side information to coin betting.
Concrete examples are studied in which the side information has a tree structure and consists of quantized values of the previous symbols of the adversarial sequence, including fixed-order and variable-order Markov cases.
By modifying the context-tree weighting technique of Willems, Shtarkov, and Tjalkens (1995), the proposed algorithm is further refined to achieve the best performance over all adaptive algorithms with tree-structured side information of a given maximum order in a computationally efficient manner.},

We demonstrate its effectiveness in speech spectrogram compression. Specifically, we show that the FRAE, paired with a powerful neural vocoder, can produce high-quality speech waveforms at a low, fixed bitrate. We further show that by adding a learned prior for the latent space and using an entropy coder, we can achieve an even lower variable bitrate.},

This paper shows that the distributed algorithm with $k=1$ over a sufficiently large number of groups attains a minimax optimal error rate up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor under some regularity conditions, for both regression and classification problems.
Roughly speaking, distributed 1-nearest-neighbor rules with $M$ groups has a performance comparable to standard $\Theta(M)$-nearest-neighbor rules.
In the analysis, alternative rules with a refined aggregation method are proposed and shown to attain exact minimax optimal rates.},

The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with constant per-round time complexity.
A higher-order generalization of a lower bound on a logarithmic function in (Fan et al., 2015), which is developed as a key technique for the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.},

The model is trained by minimizing the symmetric Kullback--Leibler divergence between variational and model distributions with regularization terms for common information, reconstruction consistency, and latent space matching terms, which is carried out via an adversarial density ratio estimation technique.
The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as a challenging zero-shot image retrieval task.},

  abstract={Learning a fair predictive model is crucial to mitigate biased decisions against minority groups in high-stakes applications.
  A common approach to learn such a model involves solving an optimization problem that maximizes the predictive power of the model under an appropriate group fairness constraint.
  However, in practice, sensitive attributes are often missing or noisy resulting in uncertainty.
  We demonstrate that solely enforcing fairness constraints on uncertain sensitive attributes can fall significantly short in achieving the level of fairness of models trained without uncertainty.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a bootstrap-based algorithm that achieves the target level of fairness despite the uncertainty in sensitive attributes.
  The algorithm is guided by a Gaussian analysis for the independence notion of fairness where we propose a robust quadratically constrained quadratic problem to ensure a strict fairness guarantee with uncertain sensitive attributes.
  Our algorithm is applicable to both discrete and continuous sensitive attributes and is effective in real-world classification and regression tasks for various group fairness notions, e.g., independence and separation.},

  This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means of bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling framework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded random processes.
  The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for constructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as well as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple reduction.
  This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio, akin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates the properties of the resulting CSs.
  Simulations demonstrate the tightness of these confidence sequences compared to existing methods.
  When applied to the sampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown that the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably tighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by Waudby-Smith and Ramdas.},

  abstract={This paper explores a modern predictive uncertainty estimation approach, called evidential deep learning (EDL), in which a single neural network model is trained to learn a meta distribution over the predictive distribution by minimizing a specific objective function. 
  Despite their strong empirical performance, recent studies by Bengs et al. identify a fundamental pitfall of the existing methods: the learned epistemic uncertainty may not vanish even in the infinite-sample limit. 
  We corroborate the observation by providing a unifying view of a class of widely used objectives from the literature. 
  Our analysis reveals that the EDL methods essentially train a meta distribution by minimizing a certain divergence measure between the distribution and a sample-size-independent target distribution, resulting in spurious epistemic uncertainty. 
  Grounded in theoretical principles, we propose learning a consistent target distribution by modeling it with a mixture of Dirichlet distributions and learning via variational inference. 
  Afterward, a final meta distribution model distills the learned uncertainty from the target model. 
  Experimental results across various uncertainty-based downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, and illustrate the practical implications arising from the consistency and inconsistency of learned epistemic uncertainty.
